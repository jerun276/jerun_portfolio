# Project Images

This folder contains images for the projects displayed in the Ascent section of the portfolio.

## Required Images:

1. **smart-home-ai.jpg** - AI-Powered Smart Home System project
2. **flutter-ecommerce.jpg** - Flutter E-Commerce Mobile App project  
3. **react-native-social.jpg** - React Native Social Platform project

## Image Requirements:

- **Dimensions**: 400x300px (4:3 aspect ratio) recommended
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading
- **Quality**: High quality but web-optimized

## How to Add Images:

1. Place your project screenshots/mockups in this folder
2. Name them exactly as specified above
3. The portfolio will automatically display them
4. If images are missing, fallback placeholders will be shown

## Fallback Behavior:

If an image fails to load, the portfolio will show:
- A gradient background with the first letter of the project name
- GitHub and live demo links will still be functional
- The layout remains intact

## Tips:

- Use actual screenshots of your projects for best results
- Consider creating mockups if you don't have live projects yet
- Ensure images are properly optimized for web use
- Test different screen sizes to ensure images look good on mobile
